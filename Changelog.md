## Bug Fixes

* Fix bug where no images appear when all images have shown (repro: when repeat count > 5, images = 3).

* The numeric updown control isn't updating so when we search its using old values
figure out why

* Automatically refresh image searches when running, without having to hit Search.. in options.

## Medium Changes

* Implement Favorites.  Add exercise option to only show favorited images (in the exercise-search)

## Big Changes

* Implement a picture browser for the excluded and Favorited parts of settings

* Exercise-Search: Move the Search.. out of settings and into each exercise giving each exercise its own search options.
